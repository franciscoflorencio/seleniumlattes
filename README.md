Web scraping bot created to collect data from Curriculum Lattes site.

You can find an example of search in the "project" folder, where we get the data (ID and name of the searched researchers, got using main.py and main_copy.py) and add it to a .txt file (accomplished using the .ipynb file).

This repository is a clone of the original project initiated by [Francisco FlorÃªncio](https://github.com/franciscoflorencio) and has now been passed to me for further development and maintenance.
